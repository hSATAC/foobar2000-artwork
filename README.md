# foobar2k-artwork

foobar2k-artwork is a web interface built on top of [beefweb plugin](https://github.com/hyperblast/beefweb) APIs.

It can display current artwork with basic playback and volume controls.

When foobar2000 is not playing, foobar2k-artwork can display images of your selection.

Now YouTube Music is also supported. This project may be renamed soon.
